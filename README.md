Penn LPS BootCamp: Project 2 Proposal

Objective: An application that allows users to interact and exchange information based on their music interests and connect with their favorite artists all in one social media designed website. This app will need a database to safely secure login information and store, update, read, and delete accounts’ preferences and API endpoints to complete these requests. When on the main page the user can search something specific, i.e. bands; their searches will trigger different responses from the API; and their searches will be auto saved so that when they log-in and begin typing they can auto-fill their searches. Aside from stored content we can create a click function within the API content to display different stuff (we can go into more detail about that later). 

## Title  Artistify: Media Profile Application

## Description (1 paragraph) 
A public space for an artist to share their interests, inspirations, and their work, this full stack application connects an artist with their audience to their favorite songs and artists while showcasing the artist’s work. This application allows an artist to increase their online presence by customizing a webpage that promotes their newest content and music interests about themselves.

## List of Tasks or Acceptance Criteria 
Given a social media style platform
When I enter the application 
Then I am welcomed to a nicely designed webpage that describes the site
When I want to create an account as an artist or a viewer
Then I am prompted with login questions that are safely stored when answered and an account is created
When I want to view an artist page
Then I can use the search bar to find artist and content based on previous posts, and comment on these
When I login as an artist
Then I am given access to edit my page and add content
As an artist or viewer when I search information
Then my search results are saved and autofilled for a better search next time
When I find a post that I like
Then I am able to like, comment and save this post and this action is saved to a database.
